instead of creating a new trie for each layer, 
is it possible to keep a single reference of each sublayer when building layer 1?
need to brainstorm
Not possible in the same way as it is now, but having introduced node.level now gave me an intuition.
If there was a way to group all the nodes for level, instead of creating a new subtrie for each layer
There might be less preprocessing / less memory size.
I would expect the data structure to be more packed though, as it would condense all the layers
or actually just make layer 0 more accessible.
For now it is not obvious how to do it, now each layer has 1 root, but if I condense them it means that for layer 1 I would need to group all of the children of layer0's root into a new accessible root for layer 1.
That doesn't sound more efficient than what I have now, if anything it's the same but more difficult to do.
What I am really looking for would be a way of working only with the single layer 0 trie.
Nope, can't think of anything else.

also, I need to come up with a good test input and reduced dictionary to test correctness


early days
search method, include hints like length and letters in which positions
for crypto pattern too (given by numbers)

level: letter -> list of words that have that letter 
layers: each layer has the levels of words that have the letter of the level at the position of the layer
example: "car" will be in 
layer1 c  layer2 a  layer3 r

still too slow

I need a different DS, faster
