TODO

29 Nov
instead of creating a new trie for each layer, 
is it possible to keep a single reference of each sublayer when building layer 1?
need to brainstorm

also, I need to come up with a good test input and reduced dictionary to test correctness




early note:
search method, include hints like length and letters in which positions
for crypto pattern too (given by numbers)

level: letter -> list of words that have that letter 
layers: each layer has the levels of words that have the letter of the level at the position of the layer
example: "car" will be in 
layer1 c  layer2 a  layer3 r

still too slow

I need a different DS, faster
